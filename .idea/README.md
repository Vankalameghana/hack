## Project Title
**VidyAI++ – Multilingual AI Tutoring & Mentorship Platform for BPL Government School Students**

---

## Selected Domain
**Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML)**

---

## Problem Statement / Use Case
To build a personalized, multilingual, AI-powered tutoring and mentorship platform tailored for Below Poverty Line (BPL) students in Indian government schools. The platform should support regional languages, work offline, and adaptively respond to each student's unique learning needs, ensuring accessibility and engagement aligned with the NEP 2020 framework.

## Abstract / Problem Description (Max 300 words)
VidyAI++ is a next-generation AI-driven education platform built to empower underprivileged students enrolled in government schools across India. It offers multilingual content generation, adaptive tutoring, real-time engagement detection, and AI-based mentor pairing—all through an accessible, inclusive, and offline-compatible interface.

The system dynamically adjusts the complexity of content based on the student’s understanding level using reinforcement learning. Real-time vision analytics via webcam assess fatigue, eye movement, and emotions to monitor cognitive load and adjust the pace or trigger alerts. The platform can classify learners into auditory, visual, or kinesthetic types and modify content delivery formats accordingly.

With integrated gamification (badges, skill heatmaps, micro-certificates), students stay motivated. A dedicated AI module intelligently matches students with mentors based on emotional state, subject needs, location, and availability.

Designed as a PWA with TensorFlow Lite for edge inference, VidyAI++ works even in areas with limited or no internet access. The UI uses voice commands and visual cues, making it usable even for students and parents with minimal reading skills.

## Project Explanation (README Summary)
1. **Multilingual Generative AI Tutoring:** Generates class-specific, syllabus-aligned content and quizzes in Indian languages (text + speech).
2. **Adaptive Learning:** Monitors student difficulty using AI and modifies lesson complexity with reinforcement learning.
3. **Vision-Based Engagement Detection:** Uses OpenCV and DeepFace to track student emotion, fatigue, and engagement in real time.
4. **AI Mentor Matching:** Uses ML to pair students with regional/local/virtual mentors based on emotional and academic criteria.
5. **Learner Persona Classification:** Identifies learner type (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and adapts content presentation accordingly.
6. **Gamified Learning:** Incorporates badges, heatmaps, streaks, and rewards for higher engagement and motivation.
7. **Offline-First Architecture:** Built as a Progressive Web App with offline support using TensorFlow Lite.
8. **Zero Literacy Barrier:** Voice-based navigation and multilingual support for students and guardians with low literacy levels.
