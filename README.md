# 🎙️ Jarvis Voice Assistant 🤖

## 📝 Description
Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based virtual assistant that uses Google's Gemini API for natural language processing. It can understand voice commands, perform tasks, and respond in a conversational manner. This project is inspired by the idea of creating a personal assistant like Jarvis from Iron Man. 🚀

**Key Features**:
- 🎤 Voice input and output.
- 🤖 Integration with Google's Gemini API for AI-powered responses.
- 🔔 Customizable wake word (e.g., "Jarvis").

## ✨ Features
- **🎤 Voice Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` to capture voice input.
- **🗣️ Text-to-Speech**: Uses `pyttsx3` to convert text responses into speech.
- **🧠 AI-Powered Responses**: Leverages Google's Gemini API for intelligent and conversational responses.
- **🔔 Wake Word Support**: Responds only when the wake word "Jarvis" is detected.
- **🛠️ Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend with new features.
